Fork, clone, and branch are different commands that can be performed in a GitHub environment. They all create copies of a repository, but where that copy is located and how it is used differ between the three.

Fork is a feature implemented by GitHub, not within git itself. When a repository on Github is forked, its entire file contents and file history are copied to a new repository on GitHub. This feature is often used to make changes to someone else's repository when one does not have write access to it. 

Clone is a command that takes a repository on GitHub and copies it to a user's local machine. The user will then have all of the files and the file history of the repository stored locally. The user can then edit these files on their machine and push the changes.

The branch command makes a copy of the repository in a new, isolated environment while still remaining within the same git repository. This tool can be used to make changes and add new features to a project without affecting the stable version within the master branch.
